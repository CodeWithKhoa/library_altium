# üìö Altium Component Library - `Altium_Library`

> ‚ú® *A curated schematic and PCB footprint library for Altium Designer - developed by Tr·∫ßn ƒêƒÉng Khoa*

---

## 1. üîç Purpose and Significance

**library\_altium** is a structured, reusable component library for **Altium Designer**, containing:

* **Schematic symbols** stored in `.SchLib` files
* **PCB footprints (packages)** stored in `.PcbLib` files

This repository is designed to:

* **Accelerate the PCB design process**
* **Minimize human error** when creating new components
* **Standardize** component data across projects
* Serve as an **open, reusable resource** for the electronics design community

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithKhoa/Altium_Library.git
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repo uses Git LFS. Ensure [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is installed before cloning.

### Step 2: Open in Altium Designer

* Launch Altium Designer
* Go to `File > Open`, then select `.SchLib` or `.PcbLib` files
* The components will appear in the **Libraries Panel**

### Step 3: (Optional) Create an Integrated Library

* Create a `.LibPkg` project
* Add `.SchLib` and `.PcbLib` files as needed
* Right-click > `Compile Integrated Library` ‚Üí Generates `.IntLib`

### Step 4: Use Components in Designs

* In schematic editor, open `Components Panel`
* Search or browse for components
* Drag and drop onto schematic sheet
